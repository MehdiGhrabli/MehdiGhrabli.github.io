This talk took place at the 2025 Digital Twins in Engineering & Artificial Intelligence and Computational Methods in Applied Science confernece (DTE - AICOMAS 2025), it presented how machine learning can be used to create surrogate models for finite element simulations to reduce computational time. This work was carreid out to enable advanced frameworks for remaining useful life estimation.
