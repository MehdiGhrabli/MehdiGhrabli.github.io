This work was presented during the 2024 25th International Conference on Thermal, Mechanical and Multi-Physics Simulation and Experiments in Microelectronics and Microsystems (EuroSimE). Its main purpose is to highlight how a physics-based model (Paris' law) and a data-driven model (adaptive polynomial regression) can be combined to obtain a hybrid model that benefits from both model types' strenghts.
