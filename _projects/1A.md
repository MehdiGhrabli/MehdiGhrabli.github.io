title: "Physics-informed Markov chains for remaining useful life prediction of wire bonds in power electronic modules"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'In this paper, we utilise kernel density estimation coupled with a Markov-chain based sampling scheme to estimate the remaining useful life of power electronic modules. The approach presents high accuracy even when the data is scarce and the prediction task is difficult, namely interpolation and extrapolation'
