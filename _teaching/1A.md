This course introduces basic notions of mathematics to undergraduate students (L1 level), specialising in management. As a teaching assistant, my job was to make students familiar with their course materials by going through various exercices and creating an environment that promotes discussions and questions to solidify the students' knowledge. I was the teaching assistant of 2 groups of 25 students for the first semester and one group of 25 students for the second semester. The topics adressed during this course are mentioned below :
