I am a 3rd year PhD student in machine learning focusing on estimating the remaining lifetime of power electronics using data-driven approaches. 

PhD
======
My PhD is a collaboration between the SATIE (Laboratoire des systèmes et applications des technologies de l'information et de l'énergie) and LMPS (Laboratoire de Mécanique Paris-Saclay) labs of ENS Paris-Saclay. Our purpose is to utilise experimental and simulated data to efficiently model failure of power electronic modules. Throughout this research, we hope to contribute to the various communities related to this topic (AI, Electrical engineering, mechanics), and to provide a practical solution for manifacturers and users for optimising the power modules' usage time. The PhD is under the supervision of [Mounira Bouarroudj](https://satie.ens-paris-saclay.fr/fr/annuaire-des-personnes/mounira-bouarroudj), [Ludovic Chamoin](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/lecole/enseignants-chercheurs/ludovic-chamoin), and [Emanuel Aldea](https://hebergement.universite-paris-saclay.fr/emi/).
