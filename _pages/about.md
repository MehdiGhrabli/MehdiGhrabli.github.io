I am a 3rd year PhD student in machine learning focusing on estimating the remaining lifetime of power electronic modules using data-driven approaches. 

PhD
======
My PhD is a collaboration between the SATIE (Laboratoire des systèmes et applications des technologies de l'information et de l'énergie) and LMPS (Laboratoire de Mécanique Paris-Saclay) labs of ENS Paris-Saclay. Our purpose is to utilise experimental and simulated data to efficiently model failure of power electronic modules. Throughout this research, we hope to contribute to the various communities related to this topic (AI, Electrical engineering, mechanics), and to provide a practical solution for manifacturers and users for optimising the power modules' usage time. The PhD is under the supervision of [Mounira Bouarroudj](https://satie.ens-paris-saclay.fr/fr/annuaire-des-personnes/mounira-bouarroudj), [Ludovic Chamoin](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/lecole/enseignants-chercheurs/ludovic-chamoin), and [Emanuel Aldea](https://hebergement.universite-paris-saclay.fr/emi/).

Background
======
I'm a graduate of [ENSTA](https://www.ensta-paris.fr)'s class of 2022, majoring in applied mathematics. I have also obtained my [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com) Master's at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr).

Skills
======
Throughout my academic career and my personal projects, i have developped skills in 
* Machine learning
* Optimization
* Statistics
* Programming
* Computer vision
* Time series

You can get more insight in the [Projects](https://mehdighrabli.github.io/projects/) and [CV](https://mehdighrabli.github.io/cv/) sections.

Interests
======
I have developped an interest in maths and logic at a young age, as i was intriguied by brain-teasers that i first stumbled on in magazines and math books. As i grew up and discovered the internet, i was quickly hooked by channels such as [Numberfile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile), [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown), and [MindYourDecisions](https://www.youtube.com/@MindYourDecisions) among others. Aside from my love of maths, i have a soft spot for physics aswell, hence the choice of my thesis. Some of my favorite youtube channels that help fuel my curiosity in science and physics are [Vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/@Vsauce) and [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium). Sports is also a big part of my life as an intermediate padel player, as well as being a football and basketball enjoyer. 

Stay in touch
======
I'm looking forward to hearing from you! Feel free to contact me via my socials on the left handle, i would love to get your opinion about my work and to have a discussion about related topics. I am also open to collaborations and job offers pending the end of my PhD.
