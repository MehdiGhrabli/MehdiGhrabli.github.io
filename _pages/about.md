I am a 3rd year PhD student in machine learning focusing on estimating the remaining lifetime of power electronics using data-driven approaches. 

PhD
======
My PhD is a collaboration between the SATIE (Laboratoire des systèmes et applications des technologies de l'information et de l'énergie) and LMPS (Laboratoire de Mécanique Paris-Saclay) labs of ENS Paris-Saclay. Our purpose is to utilise experimental and simulated data to efficiently model failure of power electronic modules. Throughout this research, we hope to contribute to the various communities related to this topic (AI, Electrical engineering, mechanics), and to provide a practical solution for manifacturers and users for optimising the power modules' usage time. The PhD is under the supervision of [Mounira Bouarroudj](https://satie.ens-paris-saclay.fr/fr/annuaire-des-personnes/mounira-bouarroudj), [Ludovic Chamoin](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/lecole/enseignants-chercheurs/ludovic-chamoin), and [Emanuel Aldea](https://hebergement.universite-paris-saclay.fr/emi/).

Interests
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section


Keep in touch
======
I'm looking forward to hearing from you! Feel free to contact me via my socials on the left handle, i would love to get your opinion about my work and to have a discussion about related topics. I am also open to collaborations and job offers pending the end of my PhD.
